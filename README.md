# Explanation of debouncing in JS

Debouncing is a concept whereby you delay the action intended for a purpose. That purpose could be something like wanting to avoid requests to the server on each key press in a search field for example. Or you could use it to ignore a double click on a purchase button in an e-commerce website to avoid having the customer charged twice.

Look at the code in script.js above to see an annotated example.
